Upgraded to CGI::Ex 2.18
The applicaton breaks in CGI::Ex::App::conf when trying to read the configuration file.
Instead of returning the conf hash CGI::Ex::App::conf returned the configuration filename
Changed the corresponding line to be as in 2.17 to make it work.
Removed conf_ext since now it is ext_conf and I really do not need it
All else runs as before.

Aded new method step_args which takes the rest of PATH_INFO and splits it into key/value pairs.
This will be very convenient for step modules to have some or all of their args in $self->step_args.
Added corresponding regex snippets to Recipes.conf
Also we will have better looking uris.

Added method pre_step to call the step_args early.

Prepared the application to run under mod_perl.
Added startup.pl and index.pl
Added example apache/mod_perl configuration.

Removed Build.PL and MANIFEST.
There will be another module which will install using CPAN.PM and will offer this application to be installed.

Fixed table name in CGI::Ex::Recipes::Delete;
